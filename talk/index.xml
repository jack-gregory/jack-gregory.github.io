AbstractWhile vintage differentiation is a highly prominent feature of various regulations, it can induce significant biases. We study these biases in the context of New Source Review—a set of regulations passed within the US Clean Air Act imposing costly sulfur dioxide abatement requirements on new boilers but not existing ones. In particular, we empirically investigate how the differential treatment of coal boilers shaped the generation landscape by affecting unit utilization, retirement, and emissions.</description>

      <description>NotesPanel speaker during the &amp;ldquo;Pandemic Diseases and the Environment&amp;rdquo; Parallel Session.
AbstractThis paper uses high-frequency data on electricity consumption to demonstrate the effect of COVID restrictions on business activity and the mitigating effects of federal support programs. Using hourly data from the population of commercial customers in a utility and a panel event study framework, we evaluate how COVID restrictions alter total electricity consumption, the time profile of when electricity is consumed, and the probability that an account shuts down.</description>
