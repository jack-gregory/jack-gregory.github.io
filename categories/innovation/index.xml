      <description>ObjectiveTo internalize and automatize the production of the Global Innovation Index (GII) economy briefs.
DescriptionIn addition to the ranking and report, the GII launch also includes the release of the economy briefs. The briefs summarize each economy&amp;rsquo;s innovation performance for the specific report year. They tailor material from the report and the economy profiles to provide insights specific to each ranked economy within the GII. A sample brief for Australia from the GII 2022 report can be seen here.</description>
