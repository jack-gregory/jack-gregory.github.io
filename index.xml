      <description>TL;DRIn this blog, I summarize the steps necessary to set up Google Analytics on a Hugo-Apéro website.
IntroductionGoogle Analytics is a useful tool for measuring and understanding engagement with your personal website. In my experience, it is probably the most painless method for accessing detailed tracking data for a Hugo site. Helpfully, most Hugo themes come with it pre-installed through an internal template.
In this blog, I&amp;rsquo;ll outline the two steps necessary to configure Google Analytics for your Hugo-Apéro website:</description>

      <description>TL;DRIn this blog, I summarize the steps necessary to adapt the deployment of a Hugo-Apéro website to GitHub Pages while keeping either the content or the full website code private.
IntroductionThis is a followup to my companion blog post titled: How to setup hugo-apéro on GitHub Pages. If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for details on how to setup your Hugo-Apéro website from scratch, I would recommend starting there.
In the previous post, the setup resulted in a public GitHub repository for your website.</description>

      <description>TL;DRIn this blog, I summarize the steps necessary to adapt the deployment of a Hugo-Apéro website to GitHub Pages. I also discuss how to use git submodules to include a theme dynamically.
IntroductionHugo-Apéro is a Hugo theme for publishing websites using the blogdown package within R. In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m using to publish my personal site here!
Even if you&amp;rsquo;ve never used Hugo or blogdown previously, the setup is fairly straightforward.</description>

      <description>NotesPanel speaker during the &amp;ldquo;Energy Transition&amp;rdquo; Parallel Session.
AbstractWhile vintage differentiation is a highly prominent feature of various regulations, it can induce significant biases. We study these biases in the context of New Source Review—a set of regulations passed within the US Clean Air Act imposing costly sulfur dioxide abatement requirements on new boilers but not existing ones. In particular, we empirically investigate how the differential treatment of coal boilers shaped the generation landscape by affecting unit utilization, retirement, and emissions.</description>

      <description>NotesPanel speaker during the &amp;ldquo;Pandemic Diseases and the Environment&amp;rdquo; Parallel Session.
AbstractThis paper uses high-frequency data on electricity consumption to demonstrate the effect of COVID restrictions on business activity and the mitigating effects of federal support programs. Using hourly data from the population of commercial customers in a utility and a panel event study framework, we evaluate how COVID restrictions alter total electricity consumption, the time profile of when electricity is consumed, and the probability that an account shuts down.</description>

      <description>My dissertation leverages electricity data for an economic investigation of three disparate topics: the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic; the implications of government ownership on the exercise of market power in the Australian National Electricity Market; and, the unintended consequences of US Clean Air Act regulation on coal boilers.</description>

      <description>ObjectiveTo internalize and automatize the production of the Global Innovation Index (GII) economy briefs.
DescriptionIn addition to the ranking and report, the GII launch also includes the release of the economy briefs. The briefs summarize each economy&amp;rsquo;s innovation performance for the specific report year. They tailor material from the report and the economy profiles to provide insights specific to each ranked economy within the GII. A sample brief for Australia from the GII 2022 report can be seen here.</description>

      <description>ObjectiveTo transition the Global Innovation Index (GII) from a disjointed data collection and quality control process to an industry-standard, cloud-based pipeline that is collaborative, integrated, reproducible, standardized, secure and documented.
DescriptionThe high-level workflow of the GII can be grouped into three phases:
Data; Analysis; and, Output. Figure 1 outlines these phases along with their constituent steps.
Figure 1: High-level GII workflowThis project focuses on the Data phase, where we collect, clean and audit all data necessary for the construction of the Index.</description>

      <description>ObjectiveTo internalize and automatize the production of the Global Innovation Index (GII) economy profiles.
DescriptionOne of the main components of the GII report is the economy profiles. The profiles provide an overview of each economy&amp;rsquo;s performance within the GII for the specific report year. They summarize model output, highlight outdated and missing data, and identify indicator strengths and weaknesses. The profiles for the GII 2022 can be seen here.</description>
